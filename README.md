# ACDC Benchmark

We present ACDC, an open-source benchmark that may be configured to emulate
explicit single- and multi-threaded memory allocation, sharing, access, and
deallocation behavior that exposes virtually any relevant allocator performance
differences. ACDC mimics periodic memory allocation and deallocation (AC) as
well as persistent memory (DC). Memory may be allocated thread-locally and
shared among multiple threads to study multi-core scalability and even false
sharing. Memory may be deallocated by threads other than the allocating threads
to study blowup memory fragmentation. Memory may be accessed and deallocated
sequentially in allocation order or in tree-like traversals to expose allocator
deficiencies in exploiting spatial locality. We demonstrate ACDCâ€™s capabilities
with six state-of-the-art allocators for C/C++ in an empirical study which also
reveals interesting performance differences between the allocators.

## Compiling ACDC
* Use a recent version of `gcc`. ACDC is known to work with gcc 4.6.3 on Linux x86-64
* You need a recent version of `gnuplot` and `epstopdf` to create the plots
* Run `./install-deps.sh` to install Gyp
* You need to put the allocator libraries in the allocators sub directory of ACDC. Check and run the `install-allocators.sh` scripts for some default allocators
* To create the Makefiles run: `./build/gyp/gyp --depth=. acdc.gyp`
* Build ACDC with: `BUILDTYPE=Release make`
* Add the allocators directory to your library path, e.g., `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./allocators`
* Run e.g. `LD_PRELOAD=./allocators/some-allocator-lib.so ./out/Release/acdc -h` for usage information
* Copy and edit the experiment definitions in `sample.sh` in the experiments directory.
* Run an experiment using: `./scripts/run_acdc.sh experiments/[your-config].sh`
